This doc will serve as my thoughts as to how this Snake Game is going to work.

This will be re-implementing the typical game of Snake.


I want to be able to play the game of snake in the terminal.


Interactive Text/Terminal Window
I think that an interative text/terminal window would be cool.
What this means is that everything that is displayed will be made with text.
    Ex: 
        A snake might look like this: ~~~~>
        The direction of his head is the arrow.
        Every piece of food the snake eats it grows by a "~"
        Starting snake would look like: ~>
        Walls should look like: # # #
        Fruit would look like: @
        
    
Movement will be done with the arrow keys or wasd
